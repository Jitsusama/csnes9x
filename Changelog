********************************
Changes from 0.9.10 -> 0.9.20 /
*****************************

  + Some new options while program is running.
    You can find them out by typing h at the prompt.
  + Searches your entire path instead of just /usr/local/bin
    for the snes9x executable.
  + A few minor bugfixes.
  + The version number has been incremented.

Unless any bugs are found, or any new features are requested
the next version will be version 1.0 and I will probably leave
this program alone.

********************************
Changes from 0.9.20 -> 0.9.30 /
*****************************

  + Fixed bug that disabled a rom choice above
    8 from being parsed correctly. Mainly because
    sscanf was using %o instead of %u because
    I didn't read the man page correctly :)

********************************
Changes from 0.9.30 -> 1.0.0  /
*****************************

  + Fixed quite a few misc. nuisance bugs.
  + Added the reading of the SNES96_EXEC environment
    variable. You can set this variable to whatever
    snes9x launcher you wish to use. (Like ssnes9x, gsnes9x, or snes9x)
  + Once snes9x is loaded csnes9x will print out the command that
    was given to snes9x as in snes9x /roms/game.smc started.
  + All arguments meant to be sent to csnes9x must have two slashes
    appending them. EX: to display help type csnes9x --help instead of
    just -h. This is so that none of the arguments being sent to snes9x
    will conflict with ones being sent to csnes9x.
  + Loads more file-types now. Including .zip, .smc, .fig, and .1
    for multi-part images.
  + csnes9x does not quit once snes9x is started. Instead it returns
    to the menu.
  + snes9x's various messages are no longer printed out.
  + Better method of fork()ing is now being used.
  + Readline is now being used for the rom selection and various
    other messages. I found that using readline allowed more terminals
    to work correctly with snes9x. If people would prefer me not to
    use readline just ask, and I'll stop using it! :)
  + This should be the final version unless someone mentions
    a bug or has a request for a new feature to be added.

******************************
Changes from 1.0.0 -> 1.0.2 /
****************************

  + Adding ability to log snes9x errors to logfile.
  + Reformated --help message.
  + Changed e-mail addresses.
  + Upped version number.
