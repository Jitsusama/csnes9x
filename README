 Snes9x Command Line Launcher Version 1.0.2		    	by: Joel Gerber
__________________________________________________________________________________

 Introduction:
 	This is a very simple launcher for snes9x. It simply searches
	the directory specified by either the SNES96_ROM_DIR environment
	variable, the option supplied by --d, or the default directory
	/roms/ and prints out the names of all the roms. It then asks
	you to chose one of them to play.
	
	This program will also accept any of the command line options that
	snes9x uses and will pass them unto the emulator.
	
	Another feature of this program is the ability to tell it what the
	name of the snes9x executable is. That way you can have it load up
	gsnes9x for 3Dfx graphics, or ssnes9x for console play. Just change
	the value of the SNES96_EXEC variable to the executable you wish to
	use. IE: export SNES96_EXEC=gsnes9x if you are using bash, or setenv
	SNES96_EXEC gsnes9x for tcsh or other variants. You can also use the
	--e option to set it to a different value.
	
	Also, if you wish for csnes9x to log the snes9x error messages,
	set SNES96_LOG_FILE or the --l option, to specify what file to
	log these errors to (it defaults to /dev/null).

 Notes:
 	If you appreciate the use of this software I would greatly appreciate
	it if you would find the nearest Bible and look up the following verses.
	Romans 3:23, Revelations 21:8, Romans 6:23, John 3:16 and ask yourself
	if you have ever trusted Jesus Christ as your personal savior, realizing
	that by your own merit you can never make it to heaven. If you cannot
	answer yes to this question, then please consider these verses and ask
	Jesus into your heart.
